//! Implements OpMove, the only way to manipulate Tree data.
//!
//! OpMove are applied via State::apply_op()
//!
//! For usage/examples, see:
//!   examples/tree.rs
//!   test/tree.rs
//!
//! This code aims to be an accurate implementation of the
//! tree crdt described in:
//!
//! "A highly-available move operation for replicated trees
//! and distributed filesystems" [1] by Martin Klepmann, et al.
//!
//! [1] https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/move-op.pdf
//!
//! For clarity, data structures in this implementation are named
//! the same as in the paper (State, Tree) or close to
//! (OpMove --> Move, LogOpMove --> LogOp).  Some are not explicitly
//! named in the paper, such as TreeId, TreeMeta, TreeNode, Clock.

/// From the paper:
/// ----
/// We allow the tree to be updated in three ways: by creating
/// a new child of any parent node, by deleting a node, or by
/// moving a node to be a child of a new parent.  However all
/// three types of update can be represented by a move operation.
/// To create a node, we generate a fresh ID for that node, and
/// issue an operation to move this new ID to be created.  We
/// also designate as "trash" some node ID that does not exist
/// in the tree; then we can delete a node by moving it to be
/// a child of the trash.
///
/// Thus, we define one kind of operation: Move t p m c.  A move
/// operation is a 4-tuple consisting of a timestamp t of type 't,
/// a parent node ID p of type 'n, a metadata field m of type 'm,
/// and a child node ID c of type 'n.  Here, 't, 'n, and 'm are
/// type variables that can be replaced with arbitrary types;
/// we only require that node identifiers 'n are globally unique
/// (eg UUIDs); timestamps 't need to be globally unique and
/// totally ordered (eg Lamport timestamps [11]).
///
/// The meaning of an operation Move t p m c is that at time t,
/// the node with ID c is moved to be a child of the parent node
/// with ID p.  The operation does not specify the old location
/// of c; the algorithm simply removes c from wherever it is
/// currently located in the tree, and moves it to p.  If c
/// does not currently exist in the tree, it is created as a child
/// of p.
///
/// The metadata field m in a move operation allows additional
/// information to be associated with the parent-child relationship
/// of p and c.  For example, in a filesystem, the parent and
/// child are the inodes of a directory and a file within it
/// respectively, and the metadata contains the filename of the
/// child.  Thus, a file with inode c can be renamed by performing
/// a Move t p m c, where the new parent directory p is the inode
/// of the existing parent (unchanged), but the metadata m contains
/// the new filename.
///
/// When users want to make changes to the tree on their local
/// replica they generate new Move t p m c operations for these
/// changes, and apply these operations using the algorithm
/// described...
